# Multi-Agent Orchestration Command

I'll help you orchestrate multiple specialized agents to build your project efficiently.

## Analysis Phase

First, let me understand your project:
1. What are you building? (web app, mobile app, API, ML model, etc.)
2. Do you have a PRD or requirements document?
3. What's your timeline and team size?

Based on your answers, I'll:
- Recommend the best orchestration pattern (PM-driven, Human-led, or 3 Amigo)
- Create a coordination structure
- Assign appropriate agents to different tasks
- Set up parallel workflows where possible

## Orchestration Process

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
I'll use the PM-Architecture agent to:
- Analyze your requirements
- Create a comprehensive task breakdown
- Recommend technology choices
- Design the development phases

### Step 2: Agent Assignment
Based on the task breakdown, I'll assign specialized agents:
- **Design**: UI/UX agent for user interfaces
- **Backend**: Backend-Developer for APIs and services
- **Frontend**: Frontend-Developer for web interfaces
- **Mobile**: Mobile-Developer for iOS/Android apps
- **Data/ML**: Data-Scientist and Data-Engineer for AI features
- **Infrastructure**: DevOps-SRE for deployment and scaling
- **Quality**: QA-Test-Engineer for comprehensive testing
- **Security**: Security-Engineer for security reviews

### Step 3: Coordination Setup
I'll create:
```
project/
├── coordination/
│   ├── specs/          # Shared specifications
│   ├── progress/       # Progress tracking
│   ├── decisions/      # Decision log
│   └── interfaces/     # API contracts, data models
├── docs/
│   ├── PRD.md         # Requirements
│   └── plan.md        # Development plan
└── .claude/
    ├── agents/        # Project-specific agents
    └── commands/      # Custom commands
```

### Step 4: Execution Strategy
I'll provide:
- Specific commands to run for each agent
- Coordination points between agents
- Integration milestones
- Quality gates at each phase

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Web Application
```
/orchestrate "E-commerce platform with React frontend, Node.js backend, and PostgreSQL"
```

### Example 2: Mobile App
```
/orchestrate "Social fitness app for iOS and Android with real-time features"
```

### Example 3: AI/ML Project
```
/orchestrate "Recommendation system with Python backend and React dashboard"
```

## What to Provide

To get the best orchestration plan, please provide:
1. **Project Description**: What you're building and why
2. **Technical Constraints**: Preferred languages, frameworks, platforms
3. **Team Context**: Who will be working on this
4. **Timeline**: When you need it completed
5. **Special Requirements**: Security, compliance, performance needs

## Ready to Start?

Provide your project details and I'll create a comprehensive orchestration plan using the most appropriate specialized agents for your needs.
