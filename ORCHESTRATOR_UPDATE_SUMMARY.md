# Orchestrator Agent Update Summary

## Problem Fixed
The Orchestrator was creating new project-specific agents instead of utilizing the existing agent pool from the root system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Core Philosophy
- Changed from "creating project-specific agents" to "mapping existing agents"
- Added explicit statement: "I DO NOT create new agents"
- Focus on configuration files instead of agent duplication

### 2. Agent Listing Update
- Now lists all 12 available root agents including `general-purpose`
- Clear descriptions of each agent's capabilities
- Proper numbering for selection

### 3. Configuration System Implementation
- Configuration files in `.claude/agents/config/`
- Each config file references a `base_agent`
- Includes mapping rationale explaining why agent is needed
- Project context provided through configuration, not new agents

### 4. Added Examples
- Web application (e-commerce) mapping
- 3D visualization (GeoForge3D) mapping  
- Mobile + Web platform mapping
- Shows how to map agents based on project needs

### 5. Clear Documentation
- "How Agent Configuration Works" section
- Configuration file structure
- Quick reference showing what NOT to do vs what TO do
- Formula: Root Agent + Project Config = Project-Ready Agent

## Key Benefits
1. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for agent capabilities
2. **Maintainability**: Updates to root agents benefit all projects
3. **Clarity**: Clear separation between capabilities (agents) and context (configs)
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add agents to projects without creating copies

## Testing
Created test scenarios in `/tests/test-orchestrator-mapping.md` to verify:
- Correct agent listing
- Configuration file creation
- No new agent creation
- Proper mapping rationale
