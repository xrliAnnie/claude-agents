# Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

## Overview

This framework defines a comprehensive orchestration system for complex software projects using multiple specialized agents. The system follows a phased approach with milestone-based development, ensuring quality through multiple review cycles and clear ownership boundaries.

## Core Principles

1. **Phase-Based Development**: Projects progress through distinct phases with clear completion criteria
2. **Milestone-Driven**: Large projects broken into manageable milestones
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents work together with defined interfaces
4. **Review-First Culture**: Every artifact undergoes peer review before progression
5. **Microservice Architecture**: Systems designed as independent services for parallel development

## Status Tracking System

### Phase Status File (`odyssey/status/phase-status.md`)
Tracks overall project phases with checkboxes for completion:
- All agents monitor this file (pull model)
- Agents act when their phase becomes active
- Update checkboxes when completing tasks

### Milestone Status File (`coordination/milestone-X/status.md`)
Tracks detailed milestone progress:
- Sub-phases within each milestone
- Individual task assignments
- Cross-review tracking
- Blocker identification

## Phase 1: Strategic Planning

**Owner**: Product-Manager  
**Duration**: 3-5 days  
**Output**: Milestone plan and high-level strategy

### Activities

1. **PRD Analysis**
   ```bash
   Product-Manager reads docs/PRD.md
   → Creates odyssey/milestone-plan.md
   → Breaks down into 3-5 milestones
   → Defines success criteria per milestone
   ```

2. **Milestone Planning**
   - Each milestone should be 2-4 weeks of work
   - Clear deliverables and dependencies
   - Identified team members per milestone
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

3. **Deliverables**
   ```
   odyssey/
   ├── milestone-plan.md

   → coordination/milestone-X/implementations/Frontend-Developer/v1.0-ui-implementation.md
   → coordination/milestone-X/implementations/Mobile-Developer/v1.0-app-implementation.md
   
   Contents:
   → What was implemented
   → Key technical decisions
   → Challenges encountered and solutions
   → Performance metrics
   → Future improvements
   ```

2. **Milestone Review**
   - Human reviews all deliverables
   - Approval to proceed to next milestone

## Review Gates Summary

1. **Phase 1 Gate**: Milestone plan approval
2. **Phase 2 Gate**: Design approval from all engineers
3. **Phase 3 Gate**: Architecture approval (Bar-Raiser + Security + All)
4. **Milestone Design Gate**: Technical design consensus
5. **PR Gate**: All reviewer approvals
6. **QA Gate**: All tests passing + QA sign-off
7. **Milestone Gate**: Human review of deliverables

## Success Metrics

- **Quality**: <2 bugs per milestone in production
- **Velocity**: 90% milestone completion on schedule
- **Collaboration**: 100% designs reviewed before implementation
- **Testing**: >80% code coverage, 100% E2E coverage
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

## Tools & Integration

### MCP Integration
- **Playwright/Puppeteer**: UI testing and verification
- **Context7**: Framework documentation and best practices
- **Sequential**: Complex analysis during reviews

### Git Workflow
- Feature branches per milestone
- PR-based development
- Automated CI/CD per service
- Protected main branch

## Best Practices

1. **Early Feedback**: Review designs before implementation
2. **Parallel Work**: Independent services enable parallel development
3. **Clear Ownership**: Each agent owns specific directories
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Ship working software each milestone
5. **Continuous Documentation**: Document decisions as you go

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping Reviews**: Never skip review gates
2. **Big Bang Integration**: Test integration continuously
3. **Unclear Requirements**: Always clarify before implementing
4. **Solo Decision Making**: Architecture decisions need consensus
5. **Incomplete Testing**: Both unit and E2E tests are mandatory
