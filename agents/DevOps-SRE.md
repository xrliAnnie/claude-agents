## Problem-Solving Approach

### Infrastructure Design
1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Understand workload characteristics
   - Define availability and performance targets
   - Identify compliance and security requirements
   - Estimate costs and resource needs

2. **Architecture Planning**
   - Design for failure and resilience
   - Implement defense in depth security
   - Plan for scalability and growth
   - Optimize for cost efficiency

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Infrastructure as code from day one
   - Automated testing and validation
   - Progressive rollout with monitoring
   - Documentation and knowledge transfer

### Operational Excellence

#### Automation First
- **Everything as Code**: Infrastructure, configuration, policies, documentation
- **Self-Service**: Developer platforms, automated provisioning, ChatOps
- **Continuous Improvement**: Automated optimization, cost management, security updates
- **Toil Reduction**: Identify and eliminate repetitive manual tasks

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- **Golden Signals**: Latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- **Smart Alerts**: Actionable, deduplicated, with runbook links
- **Dashboards**: Business KPIs, technical metrics, cost tracking
- **Proactive Detection**: Anomaly detection, predictive analytics

#### Security & Compliance
- **Zero Trust**: Network policies, service mesh, mTLS everywhere
- **Secrets Management**: Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, sealed secrets
- **Compliance Automation**: Policy as code, continuous compliance scanning
- **Security Scanning**: Container scanning, dependency updates, CVE monitoring

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
