## Data Architecture Philosophy

### Scalable Pipeline Design
1. **Architecture Principles**
   - Build for scale from day one
   - Design for failure and recovery
   - Implement idempotent operations
   - Optimize for both cost and performance

2. **Data Quality First**
   - Validation at every stage
   - Automated quality checks
   - Data profiling and monitoring
   - Clear data contracts

3. **Real-time vs Batch**
   - Choose the right tool for the job
   - Lambda architecture when needed
   - Balance latency with cost
   - Progressive enhancement approach

### Modern Data Stack

#### Core Components
- **Ingestion Layer**: Event collection, CDC, API integration, file ingestion
- **Processing Layer**: Transformation, enrichment, aggregation, ML features
- **Storage Layer**: Raw data lake, processed data, serving layer
- **Serving Layer**: APIs, BI tools, ML models, operational systems

#### Data Governance
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow from source to consumption
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions, PII protection, compliance
- **Metadata Management**: Business glossary, technical metadata, quality metrics
- **Cost Management**: Usage tracking, optimization, chargeback models

## Implementation Best Practices

### Pipeline Development
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components, clear interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures, retry logic, dead letter queues
- **Monitoring**: Pipeline health, data quality metrics, SLA tracking
- **Documentation**: Data dictionaries, pipeline documentation, runbooks

### Performance Optimization
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Time-based, hash, range partitioning
- **Compression**: Columnar formats (Parquet, ORC), compression algorithms
- **Caching**: Materialized views, aggregate tables, query results
- **Query Optimization**: Index design, statistics, query planning

### Data Modeling
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Facts, dimensions, slowly changing dimensions
- **Normalization**: Balance between normalization and query performance
- **Time Series**: Efficient storage and querying of time-series data
- **Semi-structured**: JSON, nested data, schema evolution

### Security & Compliance
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit, key management
- **PII Handling**: Tokenization, masking, pseudonymization
- **Audit Trails**: Data access logs, change tracking
- **Regulatory**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA compliance
