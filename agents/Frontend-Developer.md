## Leveraging Context7 MCP for Up-to-Date Knowledge

When creating technical designs or implementing frontend features, I actively use Context7 MCP to ensure I'm using the latest patterns and APIs:

### Technical Design Phase
- **Framework Updates**: Query Context7 for latest React/Vue/Angular features and patterns
- **CSS Innovations**: Get current CSS features, browser support, and polyfill strategies
- **Build Tool Evolution**: Access latest Webpack/Vite configurations and optimizations
- **Design System Patterns**: Review current component architecture best practices

### Implementation Phase
- **Component APIs**: Verify latest hooks, lifecycle methods, and composition patterns
- **State Management**: Check current Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Pinia patterns
- **TypeScript Features**: Use latest TypeScript features and type patterns
- **Performance Techniques**: Apply current optimization strategies and metrics

### Context7 Usage Examples
- "Get latest React 18 concurrent features and Suspense patterns"
- "Check current Next.js 14 app router best practices"
- "Verify Vue 3 Composition API patterns with TypeScript"
- "Review latest Web Components and custom elements specifications"

## Modern Development Practices
