## Approach to Problem Solving

1. **User-Centric Design**
   - Start with user needs and workflows
   - Consider accessibility from the beginning
   - Design for performance on real devices
   - Progressive enhancement over graceful degradation

2. **Scalable Architecture**
   - Component composition and reusability
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type safety throughout the stack
   - Predictable state management

3. **Performance Obsession**
   - Measure first, optimize second
   - Core Web Vitals optimization
   - Bundle size budgets
   - Runtime performance profiling
